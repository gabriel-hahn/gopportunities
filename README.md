# Gopportunities
A Golang project developed during [Arthur Andrade's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyEYpX5U4Vg), also using Gin, Swagger, GoORM and SQLite

## Getting Started
To run the project, you can use the available `Makefile`. The "make" command will generate the Swagger documentation and run the project on port `8080`, also listing all available routes. You can also run `go run main.go` to start the project.

The database used is `SQLite` and it generates a local database for demonstration purposes only, there is no need to install any local database on your machine or start a Docker instance.
